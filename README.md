# Sentiment-Classification-of-internet-Memes-PAI-Proj
The project involves sentiment classification of internet memes using both image and text data. Six classifiers are trained using the sklearn library, three for images and three for text. Majority voting is performed based on the labels returned by the classifiers. Confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-measure are displayed for each classifier. The project also includes building a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. Users can input memes on the web application, and the sentiment (positive, negative, very positive, very negative, or neutral) is predicted. Creativity in designing a user-friendly web application is encouraged as it contributes to the project's overall evaluation.
